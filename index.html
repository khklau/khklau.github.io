<p>Welcome to my blog. I'll be posting thoughts on software, microprocessors, maths, engineering and more.</p>

<p>The tagline for this blog is a twist on the title of various "Teach Yourself X in 21 Days" books. Peter Norvig has advocated <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">teaching yourself programming in ten years</a>, but I don't think even 10 years is enough. I think you can spend a whole lifetime trying to master programming and not even cover a fraction of what's our there to learn. It's an impossible goal, so the best you can do is learn as much as you can and enjoy the journey!</p>
