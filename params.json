{"name":"Kean's Blog","tagline":"Mastering computers in 21 decades...","body":"### Welcome\r\nWelcome to my blog. I'll be posting thoughts on software, microprocessors, maths, engineering and more.\r\n\r\nThe tagline for this blog is a twist on the title of various \"Teach Yourself X in 21 Days\" books. Peter Norvig has advocated [teaching yourself programming in ten years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html), but I don't think even 10 years is enough. I think you can spend a whole lifetime trying to master programming and not even cover a fraction of what's our there to learn. It's an impossible goal, so the best you can do is learn as much as you can and enjoy the journey!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
